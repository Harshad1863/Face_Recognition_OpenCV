What We Used?
1.Python
2.openCV
3.haarcascade
4.trainer(LBPH)

OpenCV :- Functions Used for real time computer vision.
Haarcascade :- It is machine learning Object detection algorithm used for identify objects in image or video.We used                Frontal face algorithm for face detection.
LBPH :- Local Binary Pattern Histogram(LBPH) is used for recognize both front face and side face.
